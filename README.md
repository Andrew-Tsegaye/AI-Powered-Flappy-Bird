# AI Playing Flappy Bird Game

> The repository `AI-Powered-Flappy-Bird` is a project that showcases an implementation of an AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithm playing the famous Flappy Bird game. The main focus of this project is to demonstrate how the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm can be utilized to evolve neural networks that control the behavior of the birds in the game.

The repository includes the Python code for the Flappy Bird game, utilizing the Pygame library for graphics and game logic. Additionally, it contains the implementation of the NEAT algorithm, which allows the AI to learn and improve its performance over generations.

### The NEAT algorithm is applied to evolve a population of neural networks that control the birds in the game. These neural networks are subjected to natural selection, mutation, and crossover, enabling them to adapt and improve their performance at navigating the obstacles in the Flappy Bird game.

Through this project, the repository owner, Andrew Tsegaye, demonstrates the power of evolutionary algorithms and neural networks in training AI agents to play games and perform tasks with minimal human intervention. The code and documentation provided in the repository offer valuable insights into the intersection of AI and game development, making it a helpful resource for anyone interested in exploring AI-driven gaming applications.
